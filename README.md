# Two-Wheeler Loan Approval Prediction

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict whether a two-wheeler loan application will be accepted or rejected. The model is trained on historical loan application data combined with additional data extracted from third-party sources, focusing on applicant financial behaviors and other relevant details.

## Data Description
The dataset used includes various features related to the applicants:
- Personal details (name, contact)
- Financial information (income, credit score)
- Employment details
- Other relevant information gathered from third-party sources.

The data is split into:
- **Training data:** Used to train the model.
- **Test data:** Used to evaluate the model's performance.

## Model
The project uses a Random Forest Classifier due to its effectiveness in handling various data types and robustness against overfitting. 
The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The model's performance can be assessed through the output files generated by the scripts, which include:
- Model accuracy and other metrics printed to the console.
- Predictions saved to a CSV file for further analysis.
